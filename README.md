## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```expo start```

Now you can open [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) to view the developer tools.

From there you can choose where to view your app e.g ```run in web browser``` -> [http://localhost:19006](http://localhost:19006)

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

You can also view your app on the expo go application for a native feeling. To do that download expo go from the app/play store create a profile and scan the QR code.
